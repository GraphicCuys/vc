# Cesar Torres

## Bio

I was born in BogotÃ¡ Colombia in the Bosa neighborhood. When I was in school, I always had interests in drawing and building models of subjects that caught my attention. When I got to high school I acquired interests in mathematics and music. When I left college I did a technology analysis and development of information systems in the Sena where I discovered my passion for programming, later I went to study Systems Engineering and Computing at the National University of Colombia.

## Interests

I am looking for a position as a Fullstack developer since I have knowledge in the management of relational databases, REST API, web technologies, agile methodologies and I want to obtain a broader vision of everything that can be achieved with software development.

## Optical Illution

The lilac hunter is a visual illusion that consists of placing 12 pink discs in a blurry circle, and in its center a small black cross on a gray background. The effect consists of making one of the discs disappear from time to time and rotating the disappearing disc clockwise, when you look carefully at the cross for a few seconds the disc that does not appear begins to turn green and the pink discs begin to disappear.
