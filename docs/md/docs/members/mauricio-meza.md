# Mauricio Meza Burbano

## Bio

Born in Pasto NariÃ±o where i've lived most of my life, i've been interested in computer graphics since i was 12 years old when i started to experiment with tools like AutoCAD, Sketchup and Blender doing 3D graphics manipulation to make digital art. 

3D Art - Web Portfolio: https://mauriciomeza.github.io/Portfolio3D_MauroMeza/

Later in life i decided to study Systems and Computer Engineering at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where i am an 8th semester student.


## Interests

Im currently focusing this last semesters on better understanding the Software Development Process with a Fullstack Web Development focus in order to get into the industry in the future.

With this course im hoping to expand my knowledge on the fundamental concepts of computer graphics work in order to start contributing to open source software tools like blender that i have been using for a long time.

## Optical Illusion - Spinning Ballerina
The spinning ballerina illusion is based around the concept of the kinetic depth effect, humans can usually detect the shape of a 3D object based on its shadows, however in the absence of these a 3D structure can be inferred by its motion.
This Depth effect does not give enough information to perceive an accurate representation of the object and small inconsistencies and ambiguous movements can lead to subjective ideas as to the direction of its movement.

I attempted to recreate this effect with two 3D representations, on what direction are the ballerinas rotating?

Now if we check the video with the lights and shadows on, it is much more clear to which side those ballerinas are actually rotating.

The illusion is dificult to recreate as the smallest visual cues can help infer the direction of the movement, however any ambiguity goes out as soon as the lights are on.
