# Bio

I was born in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. Since I was in school, I has been
interested in maths, and science, and solving problems through the technological tools. When I finished the school, I was looking for a career that was fit with my preferences, so I search for different careers (especially engineering careers), where I found the systems and computing engineering, and I was interested in programming, artificial intelligence and applications/games development.

Currently I am a Systems and Computing Engineering Student at the
National University of Colombia (10th semester).

Software engineering, applications development, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

# Contributions

Some small contributions on internal and external projects to the University, especially in Frontend, with the development teams in different methodologies.

# Hobbies

- Table tennis practice

# Optical illusion (Ebbinghaus illusion)

The Ebbinghaus illusion is an optical illusion discovered by Hermann Ebbinghaus. This is an illusion that involves the distance perception instead the size perception. We draw two central circles with the same size, then draw two sets of circles that surround the central circles. The explanation says that if one of these sets of circles is closer to its center than the other set, then this central circle appears smaller than the other. Also the size of the surrounding circles helps to the distance perception; if the size of the set is smaller, then distance appears to be small. Example:
